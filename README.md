# Code Refactor Starter Code

User Story we were given for the website.
"AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"

With the user story in mind the code needs to be updated so that when.. 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

when all of the criteria have been met then the module is complete. 

One of the big challenges I had with this challenge involved git. I encountered a few errors when trying to upload the clone version to my repository. It took a lot of research to figure it out and I'm glad to say that I accomplished it on my own. So I definitely learned my way around git and github. Another thing I learned was the importance of using semantic code. It really does make reading and finding things in the code much easier, along with it also helping with search engine optimization.
